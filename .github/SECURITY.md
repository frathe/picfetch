# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

PicFetch is a desktop application distributed as pre-built binaries on the
[Releases page](https://github.com/frathe/picfetch/releases). Only the
**latest release** is supported with security fixes; please update before
reporting an issue to confirm it's still reproducible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report it privately using one of these channels:

- [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/frathe/picfetch/security/advisories/new)
  for this repository (preferred)
- Email florianrathe@gmail.com

Please include:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce, including the OS/platform and PicFetch version
- Any relevant logs, sample files, or proof-of-concept code

You should expect an initial response within a few days. If the issue is
confirmed, a fix will be prepared and a new release published; you'll be
credited in the release notes unless you'd prefer otherwise.

## Scope

This project is a local, offline image viewer — it doesn't run a network
service or process untrusted input beyond image files you choose to open.
Reports of particular interest include crashes or memory-safety issues
triggered by malformed image files (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, BMP, TIFF, ICO,
XPM, AVIF, SVG, camera RAW containers) and issues in the AVIF WASM decoder and the
SVG rasterizer.
Dependency vulnerabilities are also welcome, though `make security` (see the
[README](../README.md)) already runs `govulncheck` and checks GitHub
Dependabot alerts as part of routine maintenance.
