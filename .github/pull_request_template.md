## Checklist

- [ ] `make fmt-check` is clean, `go vet ./...` and `go test -timeout 20m -race ./...` pass
- [ ] User-visible strings go through `lang.L`, with the key added to every
      bundle in `translations/`
- [ ] `internal/ui/help/manual.md` and `manual_de.md` updated, if this
      changes documented behavior
- [ ] `ARCHITECTURE.md` updated, if this changes the package structure
- [ ] No new TODO/FIXME comments — open items go in `todos.md` instead
