// pixels somewhere new", not "write them back where they came from":
//
//   - The source format doesn't matter. imaging.CanEncode gates saving
//     because SaveRotated must re-encode the file in its own format; an
//     export picks the destination's format instead, which is exactly how a
//     WebP or HEIC (decode-only in this module's dependencies) gets out.
//   - An animation doesn't matter. Save Changes refuses one because it would
//     have to re-rotate and re-encode every frame; exporting the single
//     frame on screen as a still is well-defined.
//   - A pending rotation doesn't matter. There's nothing to persist - an
//     export writes whatever is on screen, rotated or not.
//
// What does still matter is !v.loading.Load(), for the same reason it does
// in canSaveRotation: mid-load, CurrentFile() already names the file being
// navigated to while v.img.Image still holds the previous one's pixels, so
// an export started then would offer the new file's name for the old file's
// image.

// before exportAs actually runs. A no-op unless canExport() is currently
// true - re-checked here rather than trusted from the menu item's Disabled
// state, since the shortcut bypasses the menu entirely, mirroring
// saveRotation's own check. Escape (or clicking neither button) leaves
// without opening the save panel at all, since exportAs is only ever reached
// through a choice's OnChosen.
//
// The other two guards are about the delete confirmation, and the dangerous
// one is deletion.Visible(). Cmd/Ctrl+E is a shortcut, so it reaches this
// function without passing handleKeyEvent's dispatch at all - it can fire
// while the delete card is up. This prompt paints above that card (see the
// window stack in build.go) while handleKeyEvent still routes every key to
// deletion, which it checks first: the user would be reading "Export as
// which format?", pressing Right expecting JPEG, and moving the *hidden*
// delete card's ring onto "Move to Trash" for Return to press. requestDelete
// (batch.go) carries the mirror-image guard for Shift+Delete arriving while
// this prompt is up.
//
// exportPrompt.Visible() is the milder one, and the same guard
