// openFileDialog opens the current OS's own file browser so users who never

	// toast included, so a test can wait for it rather than leave it
	// running into the next one. That matters more than it looks:
	// reportChooserError renders a toast, and under the fyne test driver
	// this goroutine's fyne.Do runs inline here rather than on the UI
	// goroutine, so an unwaited-for failure path measures text
	// concurrently with whatever the test goroutine is laying out - which
	// races inside Fyne's own global font-metrics cache (internal/cache's
	// setAlive writes an expiry stamp unguarded).

// runFileChooser is split out from openFileDialog so tests can call it
// directly on the test goroutine instead of through a spawned one. It used
// to dodge a real data race, too: handleDrop below would write
// v.scanOp.done and v.load from a background goroutine with nothing
// synchronizing those writes against a test goroutine reading them, the
// same hazard documented on the zenity-specific tests this replaced. Both
// are completion.Signal values now, internally synchronized by their own
// mutex, so that race is gone - but the split stays useful: it keeps a
// test on a single goroutine, and handleDrop still touches other viewer
// fields (the welcome/dropzone widgets, v.state) that carry no
// synchronization of their own, which a spawned goroutine racing the test
// goroutine would still hit. Production always reaches runFileChooser
// through the goroutine in openFileDialog above.

// reportChooserError always logs a chooser failure - via fyne.LogError, so
// it's visible in a terminal or Console.app even though nothing else prints
// anything here - and, on macOS and Windows only, also shows it as a toast.
// Those two platforms' own choosers already swallow a plain user cancel
// internally (see internal/filepicker's darwin runModal-response check and
// Windows ShowDialog-result check), so any error reaching here on them is a
// genuine failure worth surfacing, not a normal cancel. zenity signals a
// plain cancel and a real failure with the same non-zero exit code,
// indistinguishable from here, so Linux stays log-only to avoid a toast on
// every ordinary cancel. goos is threaded through as a parameter (rather
// than reading runtime.GOOS directly in here) purely so tests can exercise
// all three branches from a single machine.

// *exec.ExitError's own Error() is just "exit status N", but Output()
// populates its Stderr field with whatever the failed command printed,
// which is almost always the actually useful part (an AppleScript error
// message, a missing-binary complaint, and so on). Shared with
// reportClipboardError in clipboard.go, the same kind of chooser-adjacent
// shell-out failure.
