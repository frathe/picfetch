// Package help is the app's documentation UI: the embedded end-user
// manual, the About box, and the Help menu that opens either.
//
// It's the one feature package that needs nothing from the viewer - no
// host interface, no callbacks back into the app. Everything it draws
// comes from its constructor arguments (the app, for windows and metadata;
// the app title; the artwork), which is why it was the first extraction of
// the per-feature split. It also dissolves a mutual dependency that used
// to exist between the About window and the manual window, since the About
// box links to the manual: both are methods on one type here.
//
// Help also owns the Hypno Spiral easter egg (internal/ui/spiral), reached
// only by typing a secret phrase into the manual's search box (see
// manual.go's secretPhrase and manualView.submit). That doesn't cost this
// package the "needs nothing from the viewer" property above: the spiral
// only needs the fyne.App this package already holds, not a callback back
// into the app. So don't be surprised to find a full-screen shader window
// living in the help package - the manual is the only door to it.
