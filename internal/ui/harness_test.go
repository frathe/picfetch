// This file is the shared harness every other test file in this package
// builds on: newTestUI/newTestViewer construct a viewer through the same
// startup path production uses, and the wait/settle/assert helpers below let
// tests synchronize with its background work instead of guessing at timing.
// newTestViewer alone is used by 17 of the package's other test files,
// dropAndWait by 16, waitUntilLoaded by 15 - a new helper shared across more
// than one feature belongs here, not bolted onto whichever feature file
// happens to need it first.
//
// ShowImage and handleDrop decode and scan off the main goroutine and apply
// their results via fyne.Do, finishing v.load / v.scanOp.done - both
// completion.Signal, see internal/completion for the contract - as the last
// thing their completion block does. Waiting on those signals - rather than
// polling v.loading or a widget's visibility - gives the waiter a proper
// happens-before relationship with everything the producer goroutine wrote,
// which is what makes these tests race-free under the test driver's
// fyne.Do: unlike the real app drivers, it runs synchronously on the calling
// goroutine instead of marshaling onto a single GUI goroutine. Never sleep
// to guess completion.
//
// AGENTS.md states the rule this file exists to enforce: every goroutine
// needs cancellation/staleness handling plus an observable stop/done signal,
// and any new background work must be added to newTestUI's drain cleanup,
// below.
