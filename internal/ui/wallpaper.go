// internal/wallpaper stores a *reference* to the path it is given: pointing
// the desktop at the user's own file would leave the wallpaper broken the
// moment they moved it, or trashed it with Shift+Delete one keystroke later.

// rotation, one frame of an animation - and is a PNG whatever the source
// was, so a WebP or HEIC this module can only decode still works.
