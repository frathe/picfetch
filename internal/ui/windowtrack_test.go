// What stays here is startWindowPosPolling's contract with main(): that it
// always hands back a usable stop func, and that it refuses to run before
// the slideshow exists. The poller goroutine itself is unreachable from a
// test - under the fyne test driver the window is never a
// driver.NativeWindow - so that stop func is the whole of the surface this
// file can observe.
//
// windowtrack.go's other half is tested elsewhere on purpose:
// TestWindowSizeTracker_RecordsResizes lives in preferences_wiring_test.go,
// because what it checks is geometry surviving a launch rather than
// anything about the poller.

// TestStartWindowPosPolling_TestDriverGetsNoopStop pins the stop-func
// contract: under the fyne test driver the window is never a
// driver.NativeWindow, so no poller goroutine starts - but the returned
// stop func must still be non-nil and safe to call, since main()'s
// SetOnStopped calls it unconditionally. (The goroutine path itself can't
// run under the test driver at all - see startWindowPosPolling's comment.)
