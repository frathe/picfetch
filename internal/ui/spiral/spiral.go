// Package spiral is the Hypno Spiral easter egg: a full-screen, GPU-shader
// spiral in a window of its own, ported from a standalone Fyne demo into
// picfetch's package layout.
//
// Nothing in the app's menus, shortcuts, or settings leads here. The only
// way in is the manual's search box (internal/ui/help): typing the magic
// word there opens it, which is the whole point of an easter egg - you have
// to already know it is there. That also means this package is reached from
// exactly one call site, and nothing else in the app depends on it.
//
// Escape closes this window and only this window. The donor demo called
// app.Quit() on Escape because it was a standalone binary; doing the same
// here would take PicFetch down along with the easter egg, losing whatever
// the user had open. That is the single most important deviation in the
// port, and TestEscapeClosesHelpThenWindow is its guard.
//
// The rest of the keys are handled entirely inside this window (see
// handleKey): F1 for the help overlay, F for follow mode, N for the spiral
// pattern, P and R for the FPS and resolution overlays, and the arrow keys
// for turn and colour speed.
//
// The package splits up as: this file owns the window, the key bindings,
// and the per-frame goroutine; state.go carries the demo's package-level
// globals over as fields on a struct - this repo forbids mutable
// package-level state; shader.go holds the two GLSL sources and the uniform
// seeding; overlays.go the status/help/FPS text panels; settings.go the
// auto-hiding slider panel; mouse.go the full-window hover tracker follow
// mode reads; and monitor.go the small helpers that describe the monitor a
// window is showing on.
