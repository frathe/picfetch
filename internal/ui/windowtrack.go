// The window-geometry trackers: how the app knows the size and position
// its window currently has, so both can be persisted across launches (see
// internal/preferences). Fyne exposes neither directly - a size can at
// least be read back off a layout pass, a position needs a poller and a
// trip past the public API into the native handle (internal/winpos).
//
// Both mechanisms themselves are shared with the secondary windows that
// remember their own geometry (widgets.Singleton, see internal/ui/exifwin
// and internal/ui/settingswin), so both live outside this package now -
// what's left here is the app's own binding of each to the main window.

// the layout pass is handed.
//
// A layout is the only way to get the size back at all: Window has no size
// getter, and Window.SetOnClosed is a single callback slot main()
// deliberately leaves free for the e2e test suite's own close-tracking (see
// newE2E in e2e_test.go) rather than claiming it here too.

// of winpos.PollAt, which owns the loop itself and every reason it has to be
// a poller at all. What is this package's own is the skip rule: no reading
// while the slideshow is active, since picture-frame mode full-screens the
// window and a full-screen reading is not the manually-placed position this
// preference is for - it would clobber the value the slideshow captured on
// the way in for its own exit to restore (see internal/ui/slideshow).
//
// It samples at winpos.GestureInterval rather than the leisurely
// winpos.PollInterval a remembered position alone would need, because the
// readings feed the spiral drag gesture too (gesture.go), which cares about
// the path the window took and not just where it stopped. One poller serves
// both: v.recordWindowPosition is where the single reading fans out.
//
// The returned func requests cancellation without waiting; Run's SetOnStopped
// calls it before the final preferences save. Queued reads can be discarded
// without a live event loop. waitWinPosPoll observes actual worker completion
// off UI, including a native read already in progress. The tracker retains its
// last reading. Non-native windows supply an already-completed poller.

// every other preference is translated (filesort.FromPref, the zero-means-
// default caps in startup.go).
