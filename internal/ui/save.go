// (rotate.go) is non-zero, it isn't mid-load, it's a single frame, and its
// format has a registered encoder. Checked here rather than only inside
// saveRotation so the item is never offered for an action guaranteed to
// fail or do nothing.
//
//   - !v.loading.Load(): attemptLoad sets v.state.index to the file being
//     navigated to before that file's pixels have finished decoding, so
//     mid-load, CurrentFile() already names the new file while
//     v.displayFrames/v.img.Image still hold the old one's - saving then
//     would write the wrong file's pixels into the new file's path.
//   - len(v.displayFrames) == 1: an animated GIF's frames would all need
//     re-rotating and re-encoding as a fresh animation, which SaveRotated
//     doesn't attempt.
//   - imaging.CanEncode: WebP/HEIC/ICO/XPM have no encoder in this module's
//     dependencies (see save.go's own doc comment in internal/imaging).

// wallpaper.go, the same condition as canExport for the same reasons). It
// also applies the Window and Actions menus' grey-out matrices
// (FileCount / DisplayedFile / displayFrames) before the shared
// refreshMainMenu. Called
// wherever v.rotation, v.displayFrames, v.loading, or the current file can
// change: rotateBy/resetRotation (rotate.go), ShowImage/finishLoad
// (load.go), clearToDropzone (viewer.go), and after a successful
// saveRotation above. One function rather than one per item because every
