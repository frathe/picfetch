// Package zoom is the zoom/pan view of the displayed image: the 0/1/+/-
// keys, click-and-drag panning, and scroll-to-zoom anchored at the pointer.
//
// It owns the widget the image is laid out by - deliberately replacing
// Stack's "resize the child to fill the container" with zoom/pan-aware
// sizing - and all the state behind it: fit versus manual, the scale, the
// pan offset, and the viewport it was last laid out against.
//
// It takes no Host interface, because it needs no callback into the app's
// state. What it shares with the app is one *canvas.Image, on a strict
// single-writer-per-field contract:
//
//	the app owns img.Image  - the pixels: it decodes, rotates and animates them
//	this package owns img's size and position - Resize and Move
//
// Neither writes the other's side. That is what lets the two coexist
// without a lock or a callback: a new frame arriving from the app never
// disturbs the layout, and a zoom never disturbs the pixels.
//
// The three funcs New takes and the optional geometry callback are the only
// other coupling. onChanged is how the app hears that the zoom level moved
// (it redraws its info overlay); modifiers reports which keyboard modifiers
// are held, which Fyne only exposes through the desktop driver, so the app
// injects it and tests stub it.
//
// One wrinkle that contract creates: an SVG's raster is re-rendered at a
// different pixel count as the scale moves, so the number of pixels the
// image has is no longer the size it should be drawn at. Everything here
// therefore measures against a *logical* size (see native and
// SetLogicalSize) rather than against img.Image.Bounds() directly. Raster
// formats leave it unset and behave exactly as before.
//
// onScaleChanged is the third constructor callback. It fires from apply -
// which runs inside the renderer's Layout - so its handler must not touch a
// widget synchronously; it may only record state and spawn. Geometry-change
// delivery has the same layout-time constraint; see SetOnGeometryChanged.
