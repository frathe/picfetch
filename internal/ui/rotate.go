// EXIF orientation already baked into the decoded pixels, and why repeated
// presses never degrade the image. It's a no-op before any image has
// loaded. Like a fresh navigation (finishLoad), a rotation resets zoom back
// to fit and, since a 90/270-degree turn swaps which axis is which, resizes
// the window to match - a manual zoom level or window size chosen for the
// old orientation rarely still makes sense once the axes have swapped.

// on screen may be denser than the size it is laid out at, and exactly the
// frame's bounds for every raster format (see displayedDimensions).

	// call sites fixed - a re-render goroutine the layout spawned may
	// write img.Image while this reads it - and unlike them it cannot be
	// fixed by reordering. Production is safe (fyne.Do serializes onto the
	// UI goroutine, so the goroutine's write cannot overlap this read); a
	// test that opens the info overlay while rotating a vector must first
	// wait out v.vector.pending.
