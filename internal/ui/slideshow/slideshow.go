// Package slideshow is picture-frame mode (the P key): the window goes
// full-screen and, with more than one file loaded, advances to the next
// image on its own every few seconds - a photo frame rather than a viewer.
//
// It owns the auto-advance goroutine, the interval the user tunes with
// Up/Down, the shuffle order Shift+P toggles (see the shuffle field - it
// only changes which file Advance picks next, so it lives here even though
// the picking itself happens on the viewer's side of Host), and the
// window-position capture/restore that makes leaving full-screen put the
// window back where the user had actually left it (see winpos.Tracker). It
// reaches back into the app through Host, which is deliberately tiny: the
// two things a photo frame does are ask how many pictures there are and
// move to the next one. The crossfade between images belongs to that next
// one too - it's the app's own internal/ui/load.go, since this package
// never touches a pixel.
//
// It knows nothing about the app's other full-window mode (the grid): the
// two don't compose, but that guard lives in the app's key dispatcher, not
// here.
