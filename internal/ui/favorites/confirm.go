// cancelChoice and confirmChoice are the two button indices every

// rule deletion's cancelChoice/dangerChoice sets, and for the same reason: a
// prompt never opens, or reopens, with the action already under Return.

// message, the confirming button's own label and importance, and what runs
// on each way the prompt can go.

// showConfirm raises c as a two-choice confirmation and hands it the
// keyboard, returning the dialog for a caller that needs to hold onto it -
// removeFavorite's own manageDialog-style superseded-dialog guard is the
// pattern a future caller of this func would follow.
//
// Not dialog.NewConfirm: that focuses nothing inside itself, and Fyne
// resolves Canvas.Focused through the *top overlay's* focus manager only, so
// its confirmation left Focused() nil - which is exactly the state in which
// the glfw driver routes keys to the canvas's unfocused handler, this app's
// own dispatcher (internal/ui/keys.go). Escape then reset the session behind
// the prompt, and Return answered nothing at all, since a focused Fyne
// button reacts to Space and never to Return - that history is
// removeFavorite's origin, and is why every confirmation this package raises
// now goes through here instead.
//
// A widgets.ChoicePanel is a fyne.Focusable, so making it the dialog's
// content puts the keyboard where the user is looking, exactly as
// managePanel does for the dialog underneath it. The dialog carries no
// dismiss button of its own (NewCustomWithoutButtons): Cancel is already one
// of the two choices, and a Close beside it would be a second way to say the
// same thing.
//
// Callback ordering, load-bearing for a caller whose onCancel raises a
// dialog of its own: ChoicePanel dismisses itself - which is what fires
// onClosed, through this dialog's own Hide - before it runs the chosen
// action or onCancel (see ChoicePanel.runChoice, which calls onDismiss
// before OnChosen, and the Escape arm of its TypedKey, which calls onDismiss
// before onCancel). onClosed therefore always finishes running before
// onConfirm or onCancel even starts, so whatever onCancel raises of its own
// cannot be undone by this dialog's own teardown arriving late and
// unfocusing it.
