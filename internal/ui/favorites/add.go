// nameEntry is the Add to Favorites dialog's name field, and the first of

// wired up in newAddDialog. A plain widget.Entry cannot fill that role on
// its own: its TypedKey switch (widget/entry.go) has no fyne.KeyEscape case
// at all, so Escape aimed at the dialog dies silently in the field instead
// of closing it, and its Down key moves a cursor *row* - meaningless on a
// single-line entry, but still consumed - leaving no key that means "I am
// done typing, take me to the buttons below". nameEntry adds exactly those
// two meanings and nothing else; every other key it leaves to the embedded
// Entry.

// widget/entry.go), which is exactly the hook a caller wants for "save on
// Return in the field", so intercepting it here would only get in the way.
