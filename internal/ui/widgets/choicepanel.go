// message and its own visibility; on its own the panel is a fyne.Focusable
// widget, so it can also be a dialog's content and own the keyboard while
// that dialog is up - Fyne resolves Canvas.Focus/Focused through the *top
// overlay's* focus manager, so a dialog whose content focuses nothing leaves
// the canvas's unfocused key handler (this app's own dispatcher,
// internal/ui/keys.go) answering keys aimed at the dialog.
//
// The ring is drawn from the panel's own selected index either way, never
// from Fyne's widget-focus state: inside the card the panel is not focused at
// all (HandleKey feeds it the keys the app dispatcher already owns), and
// inside a dialog it is a single focus stop whose selection still has to move
// under the arrow keys. Same manual model internal/ui/favorites' managePanel
