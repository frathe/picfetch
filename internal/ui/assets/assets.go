// Package assets holds the images the UI embeds into the binary.
//
// They live here, beside the package that draws them, because //go:embed
// cannot reference a parent directory - a file can only be embedded by a
// package at or below its own directory. The app's other artwork stays at
// the module root's assets/ directory instead, since it's consumed by the
// build rather than the program: appIcon.png by the Makefile/FyneApp.toml
// packaging step, header.png by the README.
