// restoreSession loads the file set saved when the window last closed. It's
// offered via restoreLink rather than restored automatically - silently
// reloading a possibly large, or by now partly missing, set on every launch
// would be surprising. A missing file is handled the same as any other
// broken file, via attemptLoad's existing retry chain, so no separate
// existence check is needed here.
