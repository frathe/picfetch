// This file owns animate, load.go's per-frame goroutine for an animated
// GIF: that it actually advances frames on its own goroutine independent of
// the test, that navigating away supersedes and stops the previous image's
// animation rather than letting it bleed through onto the new one, and that
// cancelling loadLifecycle wakes a sleeping frame delay immediately instead
// of leaving it to sleep out the rest of the interval. Cancellation is what
// *stops* an animation, so that wake-up test belongs to animate's contract
// here rather than to invalidateLoad's own load_test.go.
//
// animate writes v.img.Image and bumps the v.animFrame atomic from its own
// goroutine (see its comment in load.go), so a test goroutine may never read
// v.img.Image until it has confirmed - via waitForAnimStopped, which waits
// for v.anim to finish - that animate has actually returned; polling
// animFrame with waitForAnimFrame is how a test observes progress in the
// meantime without racing those writes. Both helpers stay in
// harness_test.go as shared harness. Tests that need a known frame index
// (or to supersede a live animation without racing finishLoad) replace
// viewer.frameAfter with a frameClock before the first drop.

// frameClock is time.After that a test steps. parked is signalled each time
// After is called, so the test can wait until animate is sitting in its
// select rather than inside fyne.Do - the window where ShowImage's
// finishLoad would race the display frames/index under the test driver.
