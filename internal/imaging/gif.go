// decodeAnimatedGIF decodes every frame of an animated GIF, compositing each

// frame is a complete, ready-to-display image rather than just the
// (typically partial) region that frame updates. It returns a nil slice —
// not an error — for anything that isn't a multi-frame GIF, so callers fall
// back to decoding it as a static image.
//
// budget caps the total bytes the composited frames may retain. An
// animation over budget takes the same nil-slice path, with truncated set
// so the caller can tell the user why a GIF isn't moving; a budget of zero
// or less means "never composite an animation at all", which is what the
// thumbnail path passes since it keeps only the first frame anyway.
//
// The budget bounds the transient decode as well as the retained frames,
// because probeGIF answers "how many frames, on what canvas" from the block
// structure alone and the check runs before gif.DecodeAll is ever called.
// The stdlib decoder rejects any frame whose rectangle exceeds the logical
// screen (see image/gif's newImageFromDescriptor), so each paletted frame it
// allocates is at most canvas-sized, i.e. one quarter of the four-bytes-per-
// pixel figure checked below. Clearing this gate therefore caps DecodeAll's
// own peak at a quarter of budget - where before, that peak was bounded only
// by MaxEncodedBytes and whatever the LZW data expanded to.
