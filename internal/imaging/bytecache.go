// cache is actually using - which is the whole reason this type exists
// instead of a plain count-bounded LRU.
//
// It is safe for concurrent use on its own: internal/ui's attemptLoad
// decode goroutine and its preloadOne background goroutines both populate
// the image cache without going through fyne.Do, and internal/ui/grid's
// worker pool does the same for thumbnails.
