// Package winpos reads and writes the on-screen position of a Fyne desktop
// window. fyne.Window can only request a position (driver/desktop.Window's
// RequestPosition is write-only) and fires no "window moved" event, so
// there is no supported way to find out where a window currently sits -
// which internal/ui needs in order to persist a manually-dragged position
// across launches (see internal/preferences).
//
// Get works around that by reaching past the public API into the raw
// platform window handle Fyne's own glfw driver hands out via
// driver.NativeWindow.RunNative, and asking the OS directly: ClientToScreen
// on Windows, XTranslateCoordinates on X11, and an NSWindow frame read
// (converted out of Cocoa's bottom-left-origin coordinate space) on macOS -
// see the platform-specific files. Each mirrors exactly what Fyne's glfw
// driver itself does internally for its own xpos/ypos bookkeeping, so a
// value round-tripped through Get then Set lands back where it started.
//
// Backends with no native handle at all - the fyne test driver, mobile,
// wasm - or with no reliable position query - Wayland, which
// RequestPosition itself already documents as "may be ignored" - make Get
// report ok=false. Callers should treat that as "nothing to save", not an
// error.

// chrome and covers everything, which is picture-frame mode's look (see
// slideshow.Controller), not what a merely-roomier window needs. Since
// Fyne exposes no size-changing verb beyond Resize and SetFullScreen, this
// reaches past it into the native window the same way Get does - see the

// do this on its own: on Linux and Windows, the state Maximize sets is
// tracked by the window manager/OS independently of window geometry, so a
// Resize call made while it's still set is silently ignored, or only
// changes the size the OS remembers for after an eventual un-maximize -
// see the platform-specific files, and callers should follow this with a
// Set/Restore, since the OS's own un-maximize placement rarely lands back
// where the window was before Maximize grew it. On Windows, normal and
// minimized windows stay untouched; this does not restore from the taskbar.
// A no-op wherever there's no native handle to reach, same as Maximize.
