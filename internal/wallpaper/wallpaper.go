// own approach: NSWorkspace on macOS (darwin.go, cgo/AppKit - not an
// AppleScript "tell application \"System Events\"" shell-out, which would
// trigger the one-time Automation permission prompt a direct framework call
// avoids entirely, the same reasoning internal/trash's darwin.go is built
// on); SystemParametersInfo via PowerShell on Windows; gsettings, or
// plasma-apply-wallpaperimage on KDE, on Linux.
//
// The path handed to Set must stay readable for as long as it is the
// wallpaper: every platform here stores a reference to the file rather than
// a copy of its pixels. internal/ui/wallpaper.go is what guarantees that, by
// writing its own PNG into the user's cache directory rather than pointing
// any of this at a file the user can move or delete from the app itself.
