// syncConcurrency bounds how many files a single pass works on at once - a
// small worker-pool semaphore rather than one goroutine per file, since a
// favorite can hold thousands and each miss costs a full-resolution decode.
//
// This is deliberately its own budget rather than a share of grid's
// thumbConcurrency. The two pools run in different situations: the grid's
// serves decodes the user is waiting to see, while this one runs in the
// background of whatever the user is doing now. Making them draw on one
// budget would let a background pass over a large favorite starve the
// thumbnails actually on screen, which is the exact opposite of what a
// preview cache is for.
// Leave one Go execution slot outside prewarm when the runtime has more than
// one. Four competing decodes otherwise delay foreground work on small CPU
// budgets. A single-processor runtime still makes progress with one worker.

// Sink is the consumer-side view of the caller's in-memory thumbnail cache.
//
// Both methods are called from Sync's worker goroutines, several at a time
// and never on the UI goroutine, so an implementation has to be safe for
// concurrent use. Binding this to a mutex-guarded cache (imaging.ByteCache
// is one) satisfies that; a bare map does not.

	// whether to keep it; Sync does not care whether it was kept.

// Sync brings favDir's previews in line with files: every file ends up with
// a current preview on disk, the caller's in-memory cache is offered
// whatever the pass produced or found, and previews that no file maps to
// any more are pruned.
//
// Each file takes the cheapest route that gets it there. A thumbnail the
// caller already holds needs neither a decode nor a read, only a write if
// disk is behind. A preview already on disk needs no decode. Only a file
// that is in neither place pays for imaging.LoadThumbnailContext.
//
// One file's failure does not abort its peers - a truncated download in a
// favorite of two thousand should cost one preview, not all of them - so
// the pass runs to the end and returns the first error it saw. A cancelled
// ctx returns ctx.Err().
//
// sink may be nil, which reads as "nothing is cached, and storing is a
// no-op": the pass still fills the on-disk cache for a later opener.
