// Package completion is the one-shot "this background operation has
// finished" signal that the viewer grew nine hand-rolled copies of, and
// that internal/ui/exifwin grew a tenth for the Location-section map
// prefetch: a channel replaced at the start of each request and closed
// when that request finishes, which the test suite waits on instead of
// polling widget state a producer goroutine may still be writing.
//
// The rule it makes unbreakable is the one those nine copies could only
// state in prose: a request that has been superseded must still close its
// own channel, without touching the field a newer request now owns. Begin
// hands back a func closed over this generation's channel, so a stale
// producer cannot reach the newer one even by accident.
//
// It is deliberately viewer-independent: no Fyne types, no fyne.Do, no UI
// marshaling. The caller decides what counts as stale and what finishing
// means; Signal answers only "has the generation I am looking at finished
// yet".
